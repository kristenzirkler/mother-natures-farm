      <p>Mother Nature's Farm is family owned and operated. We have been farming at this location since 1968, we planted pine trees in 1980, and our pumpkin patch we started in 1991. We also harvest vegetables, corn, peaches and apples to name a few. We provide lots of grassy areas for birthday parties or any other occasions you can think of. We do school tours for thousands of children.</p>
      <p>Mother Nature's Farm has so many activities, it will be hard to experience everything in one day.</p>
      <p>We have a pumpkin patch where you can select from thousands of pumpkins, and then use your artistic skills to decorate it as you wish!</p>

      <p>If you are not the creative type, don't worry. There is much more for you at the farm!</p>
      <p>Visit and feed the farmyard animals, take a hay ride, or run through Alexander's Adventure Maze.</p>
      <p>When you get hungry, visit Maneau's Munchies or let us make you some cotton candy.</p>
